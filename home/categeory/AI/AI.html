10 Best AI(Artificial Intelligence) Examples
  
  
  
  </h>
 
 
 
<p>
  Artificial Intelligence, A machine that could interact with a human, In a true way, The concept of A.I was began from myths and rumours, like, "What if robots start thinking like humans and dominate the world?". Many of the scientists were inspired by the idea of a mechanical brain.
    For me us it's all started with SIRI, a virtual assistant that is part of Apple Inc, "Tesla" an A.I that is capable of self-driving and many other prognostic capabilities.
  Good thing is, the machine hasn't taken over us(mostly not totally) YET. Here is the of top 10 abilities of A.I that surprised the human kind.

  <p class="info">
  Mentioning SIRI as my first A.I impression makes me sound ignorant about all the previous attempts for successful A.Is. Claiming them as A.I doesn't make them work on their own. They are totally programmed. There is a required software which reads the aircraft's position. And then commands the flight system so that aircraft wings it way. The unexpected and surprisingly early use of AI technology was started decades ago in 1914.

  Spam Filter
    
  </div>
  <p class="info">
 A spam filter could be a program that finds uninvited and unwanted email and forestalls those messages from reaching a user's inbox. Like different kinds of filtering programs, a spam filter looks out for criteria on that it bases judgments. for instance, the best and earliest versions (such one out there with Microsoft's Hotmail) are often set to look at for specific words within the subject line of messages and to exclude these from the user's inbox. This methodology isn't particularly effective, too typically omitting absolutely legitimate messages and lease actual spam through. additional refined programs, like bayesian filters or different heuristic filters, conceive to determine spam through suspicious word patterns or word frequency.

Financial Trading - Stock Market
    
    
  </div>
  <p class="info">
 Many of us are desirous to be able to predict what the stock markets can do on any given time of day for one and only one obvious reason like earning money(who doesn't want it).
But machine learning algorithms are becoming near to perfect all the time.
Many prestigious commerce companies use algorithms systems to predict and execute trades at high speeds and high volume.
Many of these rely on probabilities and chances, but even a trade with a relatively low probability, at a high enough volume or speed, can turn huge profits for the firms.
And humans can’t presumably contend with machines once it involves intense Brobdingnagian quantities of knowledge or the speed with that they'll execute a trade.

Medical Healthcare

  <p class="info">
Machine learning algorithms will undertake additional data and spot a lot of patterns than their human counterparts.
One study used computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) once to review the first diagnostic technique scans of girls World Health Organization later developed carcinoma, and therefore the pc noticed fifty-two of the cancers
as much as a year before the ladies were formally diagnosed.
In Addition, machine learning may be accustomed to perceiving risk factors for illness in giant populations.
The company came up with an algorithmic program that was able to establish eight variables to predict evitable hospitalizations in polygenic disorder patients.

Chess

    
    
  </div>
  
  
   <p class="info"> While researching about the article and all the top lists of A.I(to check if I forgot any AI that deserves to be in the list), I was hoping to find out chess as number 3 or 4 in the top 10 lists. It was such a shame I could not find any. It always amazed me how computer always defeated me in chess(FYI I had set the difficulty to most hard). It was a long and such interesting journey for a Chess AI that most of us never knew.

  A.I is just not about robots talking like humans, or not just about costly self driving car and voice controlled smart home. Most of us don't afford them. That doesn't means we never used A.I. In Social Media most of your decisions are being worked out by A.I. From the posts that you upload on facebook, tweets you do on tweeter, to the face recognition by snapchat and similiar image search by pinterest, everything is curated by AI.

Tesla

    
    
  </div>
  
  
   <p class="info"> Tesla’s program's lead is so massive it ought to worry other automakers and will even weigh down the pace of innovation because of the dearth of competition. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla a.k.a Tony Stark of real life, his mission has been to escalate the world's transformation to a sustainable energy future. Tesla is one of the best car ever assembled on the earth. If you don't own a Tesla, You have no clue what you are missing. Tesla is way ahead from it's fellow automaker competitors.

Apple's Siri



    
    
  </div>
  
 <p class="info"> No doubt if you talk about AI assistant it's all started from Siri. Though, since few years Siri lost its way. Siri has been criticized by its poor performance with respect to other competitors assistants like Google Assistant, Alexa by Amazon and Cortana by Microsoft. Google Assistant outranked Siri by a significant margin. According to the test by digital marketing firm Stone Temple, Siri has a great sense of humour among all assistants.
Siri can be accessed on nearly any Apple device, including laptops, desktops, mobile phones, tabs, smartwatches, and even iPods. Apple also sells its own speaker, the HomePod ($349), On which you can have access over Siri.

 Amazon's Alexa




    
    
  </div>
   <p class="info"> 
   It's been proved that Alexa is learning at a faster rate than any other AI assistants. The Alexa by Amazon is outranked Siri in many ways like answers accuracy and answers attempts. Tho Alexa has a long way to go. It seems impossible for Alexa to outrank Google's Assistant and Microsoft Assistant because both have owned the biggest search engines for over a decade.

 Google assistant and Microsoft Cortana




    
    
  </div>
  
 <p class="info"> 
  Microsoft and Google both have owned the biggest search engines for over a decade. However, for this reason, I haven't ranked them first in the list. Google Assistant is the smartest AI assistant. Microsoft Cortana came out to be better than everyone expected way smarter than anyone assumed, Microsoft Cortana is surprisingly good. Cortana outperformed Google Assistant on Google Home.
